// WindowDaylight (Agent G) — makes the WINDOW the light source when the lamps are off.
//
// The physically-correct model for "light comes in through the window" (see the offline-renderer
// "light portal" standard: Blender Cycles / Arnold / V-Ray / Corona all put an inward-facing light
// primitive on the window plane): for each real window aperture we place
//   1) a THREE.RectAreaLight sized to the opening, aimed INTO the room — the soft, area-shaped
//      "sky" fill that is brightest at the opening and falls off with distance (a RectAreaLight
//      casts no raster shadow, but it produces the directional bright-near/dim-far daylight
//      gradient on its own; the sun — left on by LightsSync — casts the actual hard window shaft
//      through the wall hole, and in the path-traced beauty shot BOTH the rect and the emissive
//      pane below are MIS-sampled physical emitters that cast real shafts).
//   2) a thin EMISSIVE "sky" pane at the aperture, tagged so MaterialEnhancer keeps it glowing
//      with the lamps off (it blooms into the bright window you see, and feeds the path tracer).
//
// Only rendered when the lamps are OFF, so the established lamps-on look is untouched. Windows are
// real holes in the walls (walls.ts buildWallParts), and the placement math mirrors Openings3D.
//
// Cross-island: reads the app store (openings/walls/frame) + Agent G's useRender.lightsOn, and
// reuses Agent G's <AreaLight>. RectAreaLightUniformsLib.init() is already called in <RealismLayer>.
