/**
 * The Roomio save ENVELOPE — Agent C owns this; each agent owns a slice inside it.
 *
 * One design = one envelope. It composes the FULL scene so a saved design is the
 * whole dwelling, not just one room:
 *   scene.house    → Agent C's House (which embeds Agent A's RoomDesign per room)
 *   scene.lighting → Agent E's LightingState (or null ⇒ E renders its defaults)
 *
 * It is VERSIONED so old saves keep loading (see migrate.ts): a bare RoomDesign
 * (today's single-room save), a bare House, or Agent A's localStorage design-map
 * all normalize forward into a current envelope.
 *
 * Published as shared/save_envelope_schema.json (v1.0). Additive + forward-compatible:
 * unknown fields are preserved on round-trip; consumers ignore what they don't know.
